Welcome to 20Qs!

We built this game so that others would enjoy answering trivia questions in a fast paced environment!

A user will be able to sign up/login, and then they can choose between the topic of their choice. The user will then attempt to answer as many questions as they can, while the timer is running out. The more correct answers the user gets, the higher their score will be!

This application was built using React.js and custom CSS for the front end. The back end was built using Ruby on Rails and it requests information from a Trivia Game API.
